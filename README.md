# Multires Transpose
An addon inspired by ZBrush's Transpose Master Plugin. It aims to mimic its functionality by allowing the user to edit an arbitrary number of multiresolution modifier-enabled meshes at once through a single lower subdivision level mesh, with support for objects with different subdivison levels.
